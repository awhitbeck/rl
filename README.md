When setting up a new development area, you'll need to first set up the python virtual environment:

`python3 -m venv ai_env`

When returning to develop in an existing space, you'll need to activate your virtual environment:

`source ai_env/bin/activate`

Install this packages dependencies:

`pip install numpy`
`pip install tensorflow`
